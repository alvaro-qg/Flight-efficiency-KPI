# Flight Efficiency Assessment with ICAO KPIs

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop and provide some key performance indicators(KPI) proposed
by ICAO to measure ATM performance according to https://www4.icao.int/ganpportal/ASBU/KPI by means of a data analysis code that parses the given DDR2 air traffic data provided by Eurocontrol at https://www.eurocontrol.int/ddr which contains the historical flight data in Europe.
The scope of data analysis has been chosen in the date of July 24, 2016. The raw data contains
the filed flight plans and the actual flown trajectories.

## Data analysis process
The chosen programming language is Python v3.9.7 with various libraries included such as pandas, matplotlib, geopy and mathgeographiclib The full implementations is modular and composed of various additional functions that are
necessary to calculate certain parameters as it will be requested.
