# Flight Efficiency Assessment with ICAO KPIs

Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop and provide some key performance indicators(KPI) proposed
by ICAO to measure ATM performance [1] by means of a data analysis code that parses the given
DDR2 air traffic data provided by Eurocontrol which contains the historical flight data in Europe.
The scope of data analysis has been chosen in the date of July 24, 2016. The raw data that has been
provided are two text based data files in .so6 format [2]. The first file is the M1 file that contains
the filed flight plans, and the second file is the M2 which contains the actual flown trajectories
